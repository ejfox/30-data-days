30-data-days
============

An exploration of one dataset over 30 days, by Mainstem Collective


# The Inspiration
There is an awesome project called [A Triangle Every Day](http://winkervsbecks.github.io/a-triangle-everyday/) where artist/coder [Varun Vachar](http://varun.ca/) improvised on the simple geometric shape of a triangle. It is a great example of how constraints can inspire creativity. There are similar common projects in other fields, such as [30 days of photography](http://expertphotography.com/30-day-photography-challenge/) or the [30 day journal project](http://www.lisasonora.com/30-day-journal-project/). It would be great to do something similar in our chosen field of dataviz.

# The Goals
+ The limits should inspire us. Looking at one dataset, and having a limited time to build and think of visualizations for it, should inspire quick, dirty, and creative solutions that we normally wouldn't think of, or resort to
+ Because there is a new visualization every day, and no repeats are allowed, we will quickly exhaust the usual bar chart, scatterplot, etc. and move into more artistic visualizations, hopefully treading new ground in the process
+ With each new visualization, I hope each participant will get inspired to push the boundaries, perhaps modifiying a design or even the code of a previous solution to push the project forward, and perhaps an ideal visualization will organically emerge
+ Hopefully we will experiment with novel ways of manipulating, summarizing, and slicing the data as well as novel ways of visualizing it

# The Process
- [ ] Participants are gathered. The goal is to have at least 7 participants, so everyone has at least 7 days between visualizations to think of and work on their ideas. If we can have more than 7, even better. 
- [ ] One dataset is chosen by the group.
+  Each day's visualization will consist of an .html file and a .js file and (optionally) a .css file- both of which will be numbered by the day. So Day One is 1.html and 1.js and 1.css
+  Participants discuss the day's visualization on Slack
